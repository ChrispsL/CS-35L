1. man -k [keyword]
Shell commands: man man

2. /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
/usr/bin/sh
Shell commands: which cp
which sh (TA said "which" is better than whereis)

3. w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing
[ - cannot find manual page
X - network-transparent window  system
Shell commands: man find
find / '?' -executable (lots of results but I just took the ones from sensible directories, ignoring ones like perl and eclipse)
man [
man X

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
Shell commans: man ln
man symlink
man readlink
readlink /usr/bin/emacs

5. GNU Emacs 24.5.1 for emacs
GNU Emacs 23.1.1 for /usr/bin/emacs
Using readlink with "-m", it shows that the canoncal file for the second one is /usr/bin/emacs-23.1.  
Shell commands: man emacs and man readlink
emacs --version
/etc/alternatives/emacs --version
readlink -m /usr/bin/emacs

6. g+o: give other users in the file's group the permissions of the users that are neither the owner nor the users in the file's group (aka permissions of the users not in the file's group)
o-x: remove the permission to execute (or search from directories) from other users not in the file's group
Shell commands: man chmod

7.
No directories under (inclusive) /usr/local/cs were modified within the last 30 days
Shell commands: man find
find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -30
(using the expression "-depth -type d -print -mtime 30", all directories under /usr/local/cs are printed, so I assume that "-depth -type d -mtime 30" is just not returning anything. In fact, replacing -mtime with -atime prints stuff [access time])
