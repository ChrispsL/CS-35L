1) Download Coreutils 8.29, signature, and GNU keyring from assignment website.
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg
Gives the response:
	gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
	gpg: Good signature from "Padraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
	gpg:		     aka "Padraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
	gpg:		     aka "Padraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
	gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
	gpg:	      There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
	Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
It looks like the signature was verified, but there is uncertainty whether the sigature is tied to the owner

2) tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz #extract
(inside the extracted folder) ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Desktop/CS35L/"Assignment 3/coreutilsInstall" #need the prefix or it will try to configure in the overall branch
make
make install #installs the commands in my folder coreutilsInstall

3)
./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a -A still outputs the 2 . and .. directories

4)
patch -d ./coreutils-8.29 -p1 < lspatch.patch #NEWS failed to patch, but we care about ls.c, local.mk, and a-options.sh

5)
Run autoreconf -f -i because there is a version mis-match between autoconf when trying to "make" for some reason
Run make inside of coreutils-8.29, but do NOT install it, or it will override the install we did earlier

6)
./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a -A:
