To flash the beaglebone board, since I bought it from a previous owner, I downloaded "bone-debian-9.3-iot-armhf-2018-03-05-4gb" image from the BeagleBoard site.
I wrote it to a microSD using Win32DiskImager. Then I put it in the board and held the USER button while plugging it into my computer.
SSH-ing into 192.168.7.2, I edited /boot/uEnv.txt to activate eMMC flashing (by uncommenting the last line).
Rebooting it with the microSD card still in, I let it flash completely.

Logging in as debian (password: temppwd), I followed these steps from Piazza:
After you successfully SSH into your BeagleBone, you should connect it to wifi. The tool we use for wifi connection management is "connmanctl". The steps to connect to wifi:
Start the connmanctl terminal:
sudo connmanctl
Turn on the wifi for your BeagleBone:
connmanctl> enable wifi
Scan all available wifi access points:
connmanctl> scan wifi
List all the discovered access points:
connmanctl> services
The access point you will connect to will look something like this:
CR3760-wifi wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
Register as the prospective client:
connmanctl> agent on
After you locate the access point you want to connect to, use the string next to the name of the access point as the input to the following command:
connmanctl> connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
If the access point requires a wifi password, enter the password after "Passphrase?":
Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
Now you are connected to the wifi so close the application connmanctl:
connmanctl> quit

"ifconfig" > "wlan0" > "inet" my board's IP address is 172.29.83.120

Update and install gedit, xauth, and xvfb, and openssh:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install gedit
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Install Firefox and check for enabling X11 (from Piazza):
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
Some BeagleBones come with X11 disabled as a factory setting.
Therefore, make sure that it is enabled before attempting the X11 forwarding part of the assignment.
On both the server and client, check /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config files. Both can possibly disable X11 forwarding.
Check for the line 'X11Forwarding no' and change it to 'X11Forwarding yesâ€™.
Additionally, make sure that ~/.ssh/config contains 'ForwardAgent yes' and 'ForwardX11 yes' for the relevant hosts.

Make RSA keys for SSH (no passphrase):
ssh-keygen
SHA256:4YwaIvoV5kqrg3dzJx3i4HGmwerAVCVWYAKk+OqX/C4 debian@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|+o =oo           |
|o + o            |
|o  .    .        |
| ..    + .       |
|..o.+ . S        |
|+o +=++ .        |
|=.oo=O o .       |
|++oE= + o        |
|.**.+= o         |
+----[SHA256]-----+

Make folder for Vincent to access and use (vincent did the same on his with my name):
sudo useradd -d /home/vincent -m vincent
sudo passwd vincent (I made password "vincent")
sudo mkdir /home/vincent/.ssh
sudo chown -R vincent /home/vincent/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/vincent/.ssh

My IP address, found using ifconfig, is 172.29.83.120
Vincent's is 172.29.83.123

To copy my public key to Vincent:
ssh-copy-id -i chris@172.29.83.123
ssh-add (adds password for passphrase-less login)

Now to access Vincent's host and test if I can open up xterm:
ssh -Y chris@172.29.83.123 (needed to ssh into my own beaglebone with -Y too)
xterm (xterm shell window opens)
gedit
