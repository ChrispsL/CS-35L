1. Beaglebone setup:
First I had to set up the beagle bone. Following the instructions, I first connected the beagle bone to
my computer using the usb cable provided, and then downloaded all necessary drivers.

To ssh into the board, run:
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
type enter, default password is nothing.

Start to connect to wifi by using:
sudo connmanctl
once in the connmanctl propter, enter
>enable wifi
>scan wifi
>services

and then register client:

>agent on

Then, selecting the wifi to connect to , 
> connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
>quit

Now we are connected, and to check the ip address of the beagle bone, run 
ifconfig

For chris, his is 172.29.83.120

2. Account setup:
Now, as the server, I add an account for chris in the beagle bone using:

user add chris
passwd chris
to make it easy to remember, I simply made his password “chris” as well

Then, to make his home directory, I used:

mkdir /home/chris

to give him ownership, use:
chown chris /home/chris


3. Logging in:
On his side, to log in to the account, need to use:

ssh chris@172.29.83.123

to login to the account on his board, use:

ssh vincent@172.29.83.120
And then type in the password vincent

Pwd returns /home/vincent, so we are now logged into the account created 
on my beagle bone.


4. Ssh agent
To prevent having to type in password each time to log in, we set up
key based login.

Start by generating a key on the client side using:

ssh keygen, saving the key to key1.txt
then, we add the key.

ssh-copy-id -i key1.txt.pub vincent@172.29.83.120

ssh-add key1.txt

Now, simply typing in
ssh vincent@172.29.83.120 logs us in w/o the need of a password


5. Test:
To test if xterm, gedit, and firefox work, first we must install them. On my 
new beagle bone, they are not installed, so to do so use:

sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
sudo apt-get install gedit
sudo apt-get install xterm

Next, we must ensure that x11 forwarding is enabled.
To do so, we need to check the ssh_config and sshd_config files using:

cd /etc
cd ssh

Locate the ssh_config and sshd_config files, edit using vim changing in both:
X11Forwarding no —> X11Forwarding yes

After installing and chasing the config files, log back out and lock back in
using C-d, then ssh -X vincent@172.29.83.120 again

now, the commands:

xterm
gedit
firefox 

all work, which opens up an Xquartz window on my computer and displays
the UI for them. It is noticeable that firefox runs extremely slowly. Like
windows xp running internet explore from a 2004 desktop from walmart slow.
