1) Clone Diffutils repo
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2) Go into repo and make log/tag file
git log > git-log.txt
git tag > git-tags.txt

3) Get the commit "maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `likethis'" and generate patch
git log --grep "maint: quote 'like this' or \"like this\""
git format-patch -1 --stdout 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f          \
> quote-patch.txt

4) Checkout version 3.0 and apply this patch
git checkout v3.0
patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
There were no problems patching, except for having to skip over HACKING, doc/diffutils.texi, and man/help2man

5) git status to see the changes/overview
Output:

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

6) Revert all changes other than .c files by using emacs to edit each of the following files:
emacs NEWS, emacs README, emacs TODO; emacs doc/diagmeet.note, emacs ms/config.bat, emacs ms/config.site, emacs po/en.po,
emacs src/diff.h, emacs src/system.h, emacs tests/help-version

Using vc-diff (C-x v =) to see the changes and vc-revert (C-x v u) to revert those changes

7) Remove all purely comment changes in .c files by editing the following files with emacs:
emacs src/analyze.c, emacs src/cmp.c, emacs src/context.c, emacs src/diff.c, emacs src/diff3.c, emacs src/dir.c,
emacs src/ifdef.c, emacs src/io.c, emacs src/sdiff.c, emacs src/side.c, emacs src/util.c

Using vc-diff and the undo version of diff-apply-hunk (C-u C-c C-a) to revert all comment changes.

8) Checking src/*.c.rej, src/diff.c has 5 rejected patches and diff3.c has 1.
I just copied the rejected patches into the corresponding .c files

9) Remove all untracked files
git clean -f
git status

        .lab9.txt.swp
        .quote-3.0-patch.txt.swp
        quote-3.0-patch.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

10) Put these modifications into an output patch quote-3.0-patch.txt
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
The file is 337 lines long

11) To build the modified version of Diffutils, I looked in README-hacking and ran these commands
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

when I ran make the first time, I got an error regarding gets, so I had to download and patch with the diffutils-gets.diff and rerun make

12) "diff . -" and "diff --help" correctly had the fixed output with single quotes rather than grave characters `

13) Then I cloned and checked out the v3.0 repo in another folder and got the source files, copied them into diffutils-3.0
I copied my modified source files into diffutils-3.0-patch.
I ran diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
Then diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt > quoteDifferences.txt

The files are not identical. There are many changes, mostly with the ` character fixes.
These are not innocuous changes because the logic of the code is affected.
